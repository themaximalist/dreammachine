- how do you build the scene interatively? so render is much faster
- edit/modify an existing scene
- save JS eval?
- modify prompt
- diff.js support..good for making modifications
- standardize on self-calling functions? makes it easy to know when an update can be applied

- tools
 - meshes
 - textures
 - fonts
 - models
- agent...go figure out how to do something

- self healing..get an error when executing? retry automatically
